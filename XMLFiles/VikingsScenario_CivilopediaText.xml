Sweyn was accepted as king of England but died in 1014 and the Brits brought back Aethelred to be their king. Within the year, Canute returned to challenge Aethelred’s son for the throne. By the end of November 1016 it was all over, and Canute ruled the whole of England.

These successes were matched with economic growth, and a flowering of the arts, sciences, and religion.

Over the next couple centuries, the Kievan and Byzantine imperial families intermarried frequently, and Byzantium made liberal use of the fierce Viking warriors, employing them as mercenaries (notably, in the famed Varangian Guard).

Initially these caballarii were housed in or near the palace, but in time spread among the greater landed magnates as well. Whereas most of the troops were merely levies called up in time of war, the caballarius were “professionals,” and even provided temporary leaders for the less well-trained Frankish units. Divided into 'scara' (non-standardized regiments), the caballarii of Charlemagne seem to have been divided into three ranks of prestige, with the 'scholares' being the king’s personal bodyguard. The caballarii could, it seems, be used as true shock troops when mounted, or could dismount and fight on foot.

The reasons for these Christian soldiers to fight under the banners of Islam were many. In some cases, as with the famed El Cid, it may have been because they had been banished or exiled from their homelands.

Supported by a special tax, Canute maintained three “corps” (totaling 3000-4000 men) – two near London and the third near York. Armed with the usual collection of weapons and armor, the huscarls were especially adept at the “shield wall” tactic, which demanded both discipline and fortitude. Canute and other Viking rulers usually placed their huscarls in the center of the line to steady the rest of the army, or spread them along the entire front to take the initial enemy assault.

The fortress was first assaulted by Danish Vikings looking to replace the Swedes as recipients of said unspecified tribute. The locals defeated the Danish force, gaining much loot. After hearing of the Danish repulse, King Olof of Sweden gathered a great fleet and descended on the Curonians.

Then in 933, Hugh of Arles gave up his kingdom to Rudolph II, who merged it with holdings in Burgundy; finally, upon the death of the last of Rudolph’s descendants, the kingdom was inherited by the Salic Emperor Conrad II.

The voyage did not go well at first, with the fleet being defeated first by the Asturians, and then by the forces of the Caliphate of Cordoba. But the Vikings' looting was successful once they descended upon the town of Algeciras, and again when they reached Africa to ravage the coastal towns of the Idrisid caliphate and Umayyad towns on the Balearic Islands.

Following the mass conversion of the Berbers by the Prophet’s words, they captured Kairouan with its luxurious gardens and expansive olive groves in 745.

Proceeding inland, the horde took the walled town of Luni, which according to legend the ignorant savages believed to be Rome, by ruse. With the surviving Norse warriors fretful, and since the leaders had always declared Rome the final target, they sailed back to the straits at Gibraltar … where they suffered heavy losses (some 40 ships and crews) in a naval battle with the Saracen navy from al-Andalus.

Moreover, when the Bulgars converted to Christianity in 864, a number of churches and monasteries were built in and around the town walls. Being an important strategic and religious center, however, proved Preslav’s undoing. In the 960s and for several decades thereafter, the wars between the Byzantines and the Kievan Rus saw it ravaged and burnt several times. The cycle of conquerors looted the treasury, carried off the crown regalia, and even stole a large part of the famed library of Simeon. The outskirts and monasteries were largely abandoned. Although it regained some significance during the Second Bulgarian Empire, it soon after slipped even further into the shadows.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_ROME_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>The story of the Eternal City during the Viking Age is mostly the story of the creation and early decades of the Papal States.

Since Bjorn and Hastein managed to sack the wrong town – they thought the walled city of Luni to be Rome – the Romans never had to suffer the wrath of the Norsemen.

By the reign of King Offa, it was the official capital of England’s central and largest kingdom. But its size and location didn’t help much when the Danish Vikings showed up. In 868 Viking invaders, looking to stay awhile, occupied the vital Mercian town of Nottingham. As part of the Danes’ campaign to drive the king of Mercia (one Burgred) out, the Vikings sacked Tamworth in 874. The place remained a ruin until 913, when Aethellaed – the so-called “Lady of the Mercians” – had it rebuilt and made it her principle residence. In 926, Tamworth Church served as site for the marriage of King Aethelstan’s sister to Sitric Caech, the Norse king of Dublin and Northumbria.

The town then fell into the Danelaw, that part of England under Viking rule. But it wasn’t all bad for the town, for under the Vikings it prospered through the 900s, lying as it did on a navigable river at a broad ford. Its location made it a center of trade and craftsmanship (especially pottery production).

An international emporium of trade in every commodity from spices to slaves, it was one of the towns given to his sons by Vladimir the Great before his death in 1015. After Vlad’s son Mstislav passed on, Tmutarakan was ruled by a succession of short-lived petty tyrants. It was even claimed by Byzantium for a time.

In the late 700s AD, the ducal seat was moved to Venice and a basilica dedicated to St. Mark the Evangelist was built, heralding the birth of the “Queen of the Adriatic.” During the Middle Ages, the city flourished as a trading center between Europe and the rest of the world, its strategic location making its commercial and naval power unmatched in the Adriatic.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_WINCHESTER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>Shortly after the Romans arrived, it seems the Belgae tribe in the region of the hill fort that would become Winchester welcomed the invaders with open arms. The Roman town became an important market and military center, remaining so even after the Romans withdrew. When eventually Alfred the Great became ruler of the West Saxons after he defeated the Danish Viking horde at Ashdown, he made Winchester the capital of a reborn Wessex in 871 AD. Almost immediately he set about shoring up the kingdom’s defenses against the next Danish incursion. In Winchester this meant urban renewal of a sorts, as he strengthened the walls and laid out the streets on a grid pattern to help the troops move about in it. He also organized the local militia into a “rapid reaction force.” Following the battle at Hastings, King Harold’s widow, sheltering at Winchester, surrendered the fortified town without a fight to the Normans.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_WOLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>Wolin is a Baltic island just off the coast of Pomerania where the rivers Swina and Dziwna empty into the sea.

Indeed, during the Viking Age it was the second-largest Viking marketplace, behind only Hedeby. Historians have speculated that Wolin may have been the basis for the semi-legendary Viking stronghold of Jomsborg that existed between the 960s and 1043. According to the sagas, the Jomsvikings were a band of elite warriors who adhered to a special codex and were loyal only to their leader.

A Viking horde returned in 875 and its leader Halfdan made York the center of a new Viking kingdom, known as Jorvik. Some 75 years later the last king of Jorvik, Eric Bloodaxe, was expelled and his lands absorbed into England, with local power vested in the Earl of York.

Although other Vikings had previously visited Greenland, the sagas claim Erik spent his three years of exile exploring it.
