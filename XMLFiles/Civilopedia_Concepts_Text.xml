Specialists are also particularly useful when a city grows large later in the game, and has more [ICON_Citizen] Population than there are normal tiles to work. There are different types of specialists, each with different effects. All specialist types except the generic [ICON_Citizen] Citizen have a limit on how many assignments there can be in a city.
