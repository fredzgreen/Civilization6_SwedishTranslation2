Perdiccas, one of the original colonists, was acknowledged as the first king of Macedon in founding the Argead dynasty. More likely, the original Macedones were barbarians from the north, distinct from the Hellenes, Thracians, and Illyrians around them, who happened to find a stretch of unoccupied terrain suitable for their goats.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_MACEDON_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>We know that Caranus, Macedon's first recorded king, began his rule in 808 BCE. Although exact details are hazy, the next three centuries saw the rather ruthless and brutal Macedones master Pieria and Bottiaea, cross the Axius to conquer Mygdonia and Anthemus, dislodge the Eordi tribe, and deal similarly with the Almopes. Eventually they came to control all the lands between Thrace and Thessaly.

Alexander “Philhellene” played a minor part in the great invasion of the Persian king Xerxes, but quickly resumed the family business of conquest once the Persians were repulsed. Crestonaea and Bisaltia were reduced, and Macedonian control pushed eastwards almost to the river Strymon. A number of older Macedonian hill tribes submitted—the Lyncestis, the Eleimiots and others—but retained their own kings, who paid tribute.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_MACEDON_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>Despite their differences, Macedon became progressively involved in the politics of the squabbling southern city-states of Greece during the 5th Century BCE. Macedonian palace culture was more Mycenaean than Hellenic, while the Greek city-states possessed aristocratic or democratic institutions. Alexander Philhellene’s son Perdiccas II spent his spare time inciting a war between Sparta and Athens, created his own Olynthian League from Greek colonies neighboring Macedon, and switched sides during the Peloponnesian War whenever such perfidy looked advantageous.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_MACEDON_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>The next tyrant, Perdiccas’s bastard son Archelaus, transformed Macedon into a regional economic power and thus laid the foundation for its later military fury. He built roads and scattered fortresses all over the land. Since “barbarians” such as the Macedones were forbidden to compete in the Olympic Games, Archelaus founded a competing competition. He encouraged his people to develop a taste for Greek literature, even welcoming the controversial playwright Euripides into his court. Unfortunately, Archelaus was treacherous and licentious.

With a direct line of succession broken, the Macedonian court became the scene of plots and assassinations while a seemingly perpetual civil war raged throughout Macedonian territory. Numerous pretenders to the throne sprang up, backed by Illyrians, Thebans, Lacedaemonians, and even Athenians.

His first, Alexander II, turned to an expansionist policy to solve Macedon’s problems. He invaded northern Greece, placed Macedonian garrisons in Thessaly's cities, and refused to withdraw them. Unfortunately for Alexander, the Thebans eventually forced their removal and took his brother hostage to ensure compliance. Upon Alexander II's death, Perdiccas III took the throne … until he managed to get 4,000 Macedones killed in a battle with the Illyrians, himself among them. The infant heir to Perdiccas was swiftly deposed by Amyntas’ third son, Philip II—a turning point in world history.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_MACEDON_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_8' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>Until Philip II's ascension in 359 BCE, the most outstanding qualities of the Macedone kings had been their rude valor and their opportunistic cunning concerning diplomatic relations. Philip added "military genius" to the mix when he set out to restore the reputation of Macedones as mighty warriors—no easy task after recent events. Besides his deposed infant nephew, there were at least five pretenders to the Macedonian throne, two of whom were supported by foreign troops. The Illyrians, flushed with victory after Perdiccas III's defeat, had invaded Macedon and occupied most of the western provinces.

He introduced a number of variations to the normal hoplite organization and its use. Among other things, he lengthened the spear and reduced the size of the shield. He added armored heavy cavalry called hetairoi and created more light infantry units to use as skirmishers. Once satisfied, Philip proceeded to introduce all who threatened his kingdom to his new hammer-and-anvil tactics. He drove back the Illyrians before turning on the Paeonians, annexing the regions of Pelagonia and southern Paeonia after slaughtering their armies.

Macedon’s control of Greece was formalized at the Congress of Corinth in 337 BCE, attended by all the city-states except the Spartans, who Philip was content to ignore. With Greece conquered, Philip turned his attentions to Persia … but found himself decorating the sword of Pausanias, one of his seven bodyguards, during his own daughter’s marriage celebration.

Though Alexander the Great's story is detailed elsewhere, the aftermath of his untimely demise was Macedon's own death knell.

His son Perseus was forced into a losing engagement with the Romans near Pydna in 168 BCE, after which the fallen king fled to Samothrace with some 6,000 talents, the bulk of the Macedonian treasury. The conquered kingdom was itself divided into four distinct “provinces” by the Romans, who were content to receive half the tribute Macedones previously tithed their king.

Philip led his people to triumph by conquering Athens, Illyria, and Thrace—the three powers who, a few short years before, had been on the verge of conquering Macedon.

Although he was briefly distracted until 334 BCE with several revolts in the Balkans, Alexander and his army crossed the Hellespont into Asia. His force consisted of about 48,000 foot soldiers and 6,000 cavalry, a huge army for the day, accompanied by engineers, surveyors, scientists, and even historians to record his successes for posterity.

This myth was so broadly believed because Alexander appeared to be charmed by the gods from whom he claimed a common lineage.

He returned to Persia, by way of conquering Babylon, and destroyed the last of the Persian forces at the battle of Gaugamela. Rather than pursue the Persian king Darius III who fled the field, Alexander seized the treasury at Susa. He then captured the ancient Persian capital of Persepolis, which he allowed his men to loot for several days.

But Bessus was himself betrayed to the Greeks in 329 BCE, and the Greek general Ptolemy had him executed. Alexander, it seems, was too busy defeating a Scythian host at the battle of Jaxartes to bother with a regicide-friendly Persian noble.

But soon enough, Alexander determined to try his hand at conquering the Indian subcontinent, which rumors claimed was even richer than Persia.

His Persian Empire was the first in history to govern a slew of distinct ethnic groups on the basis of equitable responsibilities and rights for each, so long as his subjects paid their taxes and kept the peace. Cyrus established a system of local nobles called "satraps" to administer each province autonomously, and pledged not to interfere in the local customs, religions, and economies of the conquered peoples.

Nonetheless, Egypt and its wealth was a nice addition to the empire.

Under Darius, the Persian Empire also standardized weights and measures, instituted a program of road construction, such as the rebuilding and completion of the 1677-mile “Royal Road” from Susa to Sardis, and began lots of public works in the cities of Susa, Babylon, Memphis, Pasargadae and new Persepolis.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_PERSIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>By 516 BCE, he considered his rule stable enough to invade the distant Indus Valley, which he conquered within the year. After appointing the Greek Scylax to serve as his satrap from the city of Gandhara, Darius decided to reorganize the empire. He divided it into 20 provinces, each under a satrap he appointed (usually one of his relatives), and each paying a fixed rate of tribute. To prevent the satraps from building a power base to threaten rebellion, Darius appointed a separate military commander in each satrapy, answerable only to him.

Darius, concerned that the fruitless campaign would only cost him more men, and convinced that Scythian fortunes had been damaged enough, halted his army on the banks of the Oarus.

In 336 BCE a young Macedone king named Alexander, later labelled “the Great,” sought to topple the tottering Persian Empire. Darius repeatedly met him in battle, often with far superior numbers, and Alexander simply destroyed his armies one after another. The Persian capital Persepolis fell to Alexander’s armies in 330 BCE, and Darius was murdered the same year. The last Achaemenid “King of Kings” had fallen. </Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CYRUS_QUOTE' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>Do not be distressed by the slurs of our enemies, nor enticed by the praise of our allies.

He was born to Cambyses, king of Anshan, and Mendane, daughter of King Astyages of Media, in either 600 BCE or 576 BCE. (Ancient calendars being what they were, subsequent historians aren’t quite sure which.) According to the tales, Astyages was convinced by repeated dreams that his grandson would someday overthrow him. Since power was thicker than blood for the Median king, he summoned his pregnant daughter and insisted the child be killed as soon as it was born. The task was delegated to a shepherd, Mithradates, who did not kill the infant Cyrus and instead raised him as one of his own sons. Herodotus claimed the ruse was uncovered when Cyrus reached the age of 10 because his behavior was “too noble.” Caring for neither a civil war nor conflict with Cambyses, Astyages sent Cyrus back to his biological parents in Persia.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CYRUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>Astyages was right to be concerned by his grandson. Although his father did not die until 551 BCE, Cyrus had already ascended to the throne in 559 BCE. Like his predecessors, Cyrus was forced to recognize Median overlordship … at least until a surprise attack against his grandfather in 553 BCE. Rallying the tribes—including the Achaemenian relations of his wife Cassandane—Cyrus defeated the Medians in several pitched battles, eventually capturing the capital at Ecbatana in 549 BCE. Accepting the crown of Media in 546 BCE, Cyrus proclaimed himself “King of Persia.” History doesn’t record what became of Astyages, but it is considerably less likely he was adopted by a shepherd tasked with his murder.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CYRUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>The conquest of Media was only the start of Cyrus's bloodshed. Astyages had been allied to Nabonidus of Babylon, Amasis of Egypt, and his brother-in-law Croesus of Lydia. Within a year of Astyages’s defeat, the Lydians were on the march. Cyrus levied troops from throughout his lands and fought Lydian forces to stalemate at Pteira. He next attacked the Lydian capital at Sardis, where he routed the vaunted Lydian cavalry by putting camels in the front lines. According to Herodotus, Cyrus spared Croesus and made him a trusted advisor—but the 'Nabonidus Chronicle' disagreed, claiming Cyrus double-crossed the fallen king and had him slain.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CYRUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>After putting down a revolt in Media by the official transporting Croesus’s supposed vast treasury to Cyrus’s palace, the Persians proceeded to capture Elam’s capital on the way into Babylonia. Around early October 540 BCE, Cyrus finally forced the Babylonians to battle near their city of Opis on the banks of the Tigris, just north of Babylon. The Babylonians were routed, Nabonidus fled, and Cyrus negotiated a truce, thus entering Sippar unopposed. Reaching Babylon, Cyrus used an existing great ditch to divert the Euphrates and walk his troops across the riverbed. They invaded the city at night against meager defenders and "detained" Nabonidus. (The 'Nabonidus Chronicles' said he was exiled and allowed to live out his life in nearby Carmania, where Cyrus could keep an eye on him.)</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CYRUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>Having added fallen Babylonia to his now extensive holdings, Cyrus also acquired various pieces of its empire in Syria, Judea, and Patraea. Feeling quite pleased with himself, Cyrus proclaimed himself “King of Babylon, King of Sumer and Akkad, King of the Four Corners of the World.” This is known from the (in)famous “Cyrus Cylinder,” etched and laid in the foundations of the Esagila temple dedicated to Marduk, the primary Babylonian god. The cylinder denounces Nabonidus as impious and depicts Cyrus as “pleasing to Marduk.” It also details how Cyrus improved the lives of the Babylonians, restored temples and cults previously outlawed, and repatriated displaced peoples—such as his 538 BCE decree allowing captive Jews to return to Judah.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CYRUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>Although some historians and other wishful thinkers have asserted that the cylinder represents an early form of human rights charter, most scholars portray it in the context of the long-standing Mesopotamian tradition of new rulers beginning their reign with declarations of largesse and reforms, especially after the fall of an unpopular king.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CYRUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>Cyrus spent his last years putting the Achaemenid dynasty on a sound footing. To avoid unrest in newly conquered lands, he allowed most nobles to become government officials and gave them equal status with Persian nobility. He left the institutions in conquered lands alone, allowing the people to largely govern themselves, and didn’t meddle with local religions, which proved an exceedingly wise decision. Cyrus also built a series of fortified towns along the eastern borders to protect his empire from the nomads of Central Asia, and formed a streamlined central government at his capital at Pasargadae which administered the regions through local elders. In short, he successfully organized the vast territory he had conquered into something resembling an empire.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CYRUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_8' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>The details of Cyrus's passing vary. According to Herodotus (whose tales are largely just that), a backstabbing Cyrus met his fate at the hands of the warrior-queen Tomyris of the Scythians. (That theory of his death is recounted in Tomyris's Civilopedia entry.) Ctesias, even less reliable than Herodotus, wrote in his 'Persica' that Cyrus was killed while putting down resistance from the Derbices. Berossus claims the Persian king met his death while fighting against Dahae archers northwest of the headwaters of Syr Darya. A final alternative is that from Xenophon’s Cyropaedia, which says that Cyrus died peacefully resting at his capital. Whatever the case, Cyrus’s remains were interred in a limestone tomb in Pasargadae (which tends to give credence to Xenophon’s account), which many believe still exists in the ruins of that great city.</Text>		</Replace>		<Replace Tag='LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CYRUS_CHAPTER_CAPSULE_BODY' Language='sv_SE'>			<Text>Cyrus looks for juicy opportunities to expand his empire with quick strike surprise wars.
